    <p>After 15 years analyzing and designing business strategies across startups, corporations, and venture capital firms, I now help business owners create financial strategies that serve both their life and business needs.</p>
    <p>Only 16% of self-employed professionals make private pension contributions. I wasn't surprised reading that. Since founding Molequl, I've discovered that none of my clients had retirement plans in place. Their only savings came from previous full-time employment. The irony? Each started their business seeking greater flexibility and control over their future.</p>
    <p>The root causes are primarily psychological. The combination of hustle culture and decision fatigue makes personal finance both harder to address and a lower priority. Paradoxically, this creates the opposite of control.</p>
    <p>My mission is clear: build a holistic framework for business owners so their business truly serves them, not the other way around.</p>
